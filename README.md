student-performance-analysis

Educational analytics project identifying factors that influence student academic success. Analyzes 1000+ student records to uncover insights about gender differences, parental education impact, and test preparation effectiveness. Provides actionable recommendations for educators and policymakers using data-driven approaches.

Student Performance Analysis

A comprehensive data science project analyzing factors that influence student academic performance using machine learning techniques.


Project Overview

This project analyzes student performance data to identify key factors that influence academic success. Using exploratory data analysis and machine learning models, we uncover insights about how various demographic and socio-economic factors impact student scores.

Key Features

- Comprehensive EDA: Visual analysis of student performance patterns
- Statistical Insights: Deep dive into factors affecting academic success
- Machine Learning: Predictive models using Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Feature Analysis: Identification of most important performance predictors
- Interactive Visualizations: Clear, publication-ready charts and graphs

Dataset Information

The dataset contains 1000+ student records** with the following features:
- Demographics: Gender, race/ethnicity
- Socio-economic: Parental education, lunch type
- Academic: Math, reading, and writing scores
- Preparation: Test preparation course completion

Key Visualizations

1. Score Distributions
Distribution analysis of math, reading, and writing scores across the student population.

2. Gender Performance Analysis
Comparative analysis showing performance differences between male and female students.

3. Parental Education Impact
Correlation between parental education levels and student academic performance.

4. Test Preparation Effectiveness
Analysis of how test preparation courses affect student scores.

Machine Learning Models

Models Implemented:
1. Linear Regression: Baseline model for performance prediction
2. Random Forest: Advanced ensemble method for better accuracy

Performance Metrics:
- R² Score: Measures model accuracy
- Mean Squared Error: Prediction error measurement
- Feature Importance: Identifies key performance predictors

Key Findings

1. Strong Correlation: Reading and writing scores show high correlation (>0.8)
2. Gender Differences: Slight variations in performance across different subjects
3. Education Impact: Parental education level significantly affects student performance
4. Preparation Benefits: Students who completed test preparation courses show improved scores
5. Socio-economic Factors: Lunch type (standard vs. free/reduced) indicates performance patterns
